  desc: This particular project was the logical step after the JdeRobot-Academy project, where we have different robotics related exercises for College students to solve. We ported that to a web application so everyone working on every kind of PC can get access and solve the same exercises in a comfortable way.

- name: Kibotics
  i18n: kibotics
  url: https://kibotics.org

  desc: This project (currently our biggest one along with JdeRobot) is meant for undergrad students to learn how to code and even more, how to code software for robots. It supports programming languages such as Scratch, Python and JavaScript and has support for our own robot (PiBot) and it's own simulator developed by us (WebSim).

- name: Websim
